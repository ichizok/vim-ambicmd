Describe ambicmd.vim
  Before all
    command! FooFoo put ='FooFoo'
    command! FooBar put ='FooBar'
    command! Hoge put ='Hoge'
    command! -nargs=1 Put put ='<args>'

    cnoremap <expr> @ ambicmd#expand('') . '<CR>'

  Before each
    silent % delete _
  End

  Context in Command-line mode
    It expands ambiguous command to strict command
      normal :hoge@
      Assert Equals(getline('.'), 'Hoge')
    End

    It completes the common head of the ambiguous commands
      Throws /^Vim:E464/ :normal :foo@
    End

    It does not expand at the argument
      normal :Put hoge@
      Assert Equals(getline('.'), 'hoge')
    End
  End

  Context in searching of Visual mode
    It does not expand
      0 put = ['hoge ', 'hoge', 'Hoge']
      call cursor(1, 5)
      normal v/hoge@
      Assert Equals(line('.'), 2)
    End
  End
